# [Single Page, All of Unicode](https://blog.unfindable.net/archives/7740)

I cannot think of a single greater stress test for modern document processing software and their file standards than what I bring to you today: **the entirety of the graphical unicode symbol collection displayed on [a single-page PDF file](https://www.davidblue.wtf/wp-content/uploads/unicode.pdf)**. Sounds *fucking dangerous*, right? Yeah...

I have a real obsession with Unicode, in case you haven't already noticed. Specifically, I've always been compelled to find tools that would help me use it more in all types of digital writing - from text messaging to book manuscripts in Word, hopefully by both *enabling* such use and also theoretically to simply *keep Unicode on my mind*, considering how disappointingly absent the traditional library has been in any conversation at all.

If you'll remember, I wrote a brief review in June, 2018 of one of my top three iOS applications of all time and unquestionably *the* most beautiful manifestation of a Unicode reference utility I have ever seen: **[Unichar](https://unichar.app/)**:

> **...here is an iOS app that** *actu­al­ly address­es* **a reg­u­lar issue of my own in a beau­ti­ful and intu­itive way. I actu­al­ly can­not remem­ber the last time this hap­pened — you’d have to give me a list and a com­pre­hen­sive refresh­er of all the ways I’ve used my iPhones in the past ten years.**

Now, in addition to Unichar's sole developer, Jordan Hipwell, I would like to submit developer [Taro Yabuki](https://twitter.com/yabuki) into the running for Digital Expression's Hero of The Season Award because of his authorship of a [single page containing all graphical Unicode characters](https://github.com/taroyabuki/onepage-unicode-chars). Naturally, upon first discovering the document, I first tried opening it in a web browser, which takes a while. I then moved on to Adobe's Acrobat PDF viewer, where I immediately (and irresponsibly) prompted the software to read the entire document aloud. Naturally, it crashed immediately.
